# Contract-and-Billing-Management-Implementation
Developed a system implementation to manage customer contracts and monthly bills, handling term, month-to-month, and prepaid plans with features like deposits, free minutes, and prepaid balances. 
## Since this project was in association with a UofT course, only small samples are publicly available, full code demonstration available upon request through email : zoyaf.18.1@gmail.com. To understand implementation, please read the [Documentation](https://github.com/Zoya-74/Contract-and-Billing-Management-Implementation/blob/main/Documentation%20(1).pdf) file in the repository

# Introduction
A program to read in a dataset of customer calls, set geographically in Toronto, and produce a visualization of this past calling activity on a real map of the city. The MewbileTech operator should then be able to filter results, (for example, displaying only calls and texts from a particular customer), or display a detailed bill that a given customer would have been sent during a specific month. We use the term "to filter" to indicate that we want to display only those calls which match the search criterion.
